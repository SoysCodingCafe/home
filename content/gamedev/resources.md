title: Resources
---

This page contains a list of resources and creators that I have found useful during my gamedev learning experience. It will probably be pretty scattered since I struggle to organise things like this, but I'll try to keep everything in general categories to make it easier for you to find creators and resources relevant to you. I will add more to this page as I find them, and please let me know if you find any broken/outdated links as there is a chance that some creators may move/rename their accounts.

# The Bevy Game Engine and Rust
My game engine of choice is the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org) written in the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org) and so a lot of the learning resources and creators I find useful are related to that. If you have not done so already, I highly recommend joining the [Bevy Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/bevy), it is a great community with active discussion and who are always willing to help. Additionally, the showcase channel is great for seeing the things Bevy is capable of and most of the people posting there are happy to talk about and explain how they created their projects!

When first learning Rust a good place to start is [the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/index.html). The first few chapters walk you through installation and a few basic examples to get you familiar with the syntax, but after that then I found it best just to reference when needed, otherwise you'll overload yourself with too much information at once. There are alternatives to this such as [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) which explains concepts through extensive use of example code, or [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) which teaches you through interactive exercises, and although I have heard great things about them I have not tried them myself.

Similarly, there is the [Bevy book](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/) which covers everything you need to get you started, and contains links to many other resources such as the [Bevy examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#examples), [Bevy assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets/), and the [Bevy cheatbook](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/). I highly recommend the cheatbook, as it contains examples for everything you could want to do. Not every page is up to date with the current release, though the most common pages are updated frequently and the version is displayed at the top of each page and is still useful when paired with the [Bevy migration guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/introduction/).

I also recommend checking out [Bevy Game Jam #1](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-1), [Bevy Game Jam #2](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-2), and [Bevy Game Jam #3](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-3) for examples of what you can achieve with the Bevy game engine, and many of these games also have their source code available for you to browse if you are curious how they were made! 

# YouTube
Another great place to learn is through YouTube tutorials, though this can often lead to going down rabbit holes of cool looking videos and distracting you from actually learning. Additionally, due to the time required in producing high quality video tutorials, a lot of these resources are not up to date and so don't cover all the latest features of Bevy, however, they are still valuable for learning good coding practices and seeing how the engine can be used. There are also gamedevs who don't focus specifically on Bevy but cover adjacent topics such as shaders or gamedev in general, and so are definitely worth checking out:
