# What is this?
This is a website created using [Jacky Zhao's Quartz V4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and deployed on [Github Pages](https://github.com/SoysCodingCafe/home).

Currently it is pretty empty, but I plan on using this as a hub for my various accounts and a way to post devlogs of my current projects. If you have somehow stumbled upon this, bookmark the page and check back later!
