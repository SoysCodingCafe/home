# Welcome!
Hello and welcome to Soy's Coding Caf√©!

## Who are you?
I'm Soy, a hobbyist gamedev making games in the Bevy game engine written in Rust.

## What is this?
This is a website created using [Jacky Zhao's Quartz V4](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) and an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault written in markdown, which is deployed to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Currently it is pretty empty, but I plan on using this as a hub for my various accounts and a way to post devlogs of my current projects. If you have somehow stumbled upon this, bookmark the page and check back later!

## How do I navigate it?
On the left is a search bar which you can use to look for a specific page, or you can navigate via the links on each page. Internal links appear like [[index | this]], whereas external links are displayed like those above. On the right you can use the Graph View to navigate to any connected page, or use the Backlinks section to return to a previous page. The Table of Contents can be used to jump to a specific section within a page, and will change color to show your progress through a page.

## Where should I start?
You're full of questions, huh? Right now the site is pretty bare, but you can check out [[gamedev_hub | this page]] to see a list of all the games I have created so far, and also find more information about my workflow, inspirations, and useful learning resources I have found.

# Official Accounts
## Content
A selection of my [[gamedev_hub | games]] are available for free on [Itch](https://SoysCodingCafe.itch.io/).
The source code for most of them is available on my [Github](https://github.com/SoysCodingCafe).
