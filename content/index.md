# What is this?
This is a website created using [Jacky Zhao's Quartz V4](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) and an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault written in markdown, which is deployed to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Currently it is pretty empty, but I plan on using this as a hub for my various accounts and a way to post devlogs of my current projects. If you have somehow stumbled upon this, bookmark the page and check back later!
