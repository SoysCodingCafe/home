# Soy's Coding Caf√©
A fork of [Jacky Zhao's Quartz V4](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) for creating a website from an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault in markdown and deploying it to [Github Pages](https://github.com/SoysCodingCafe/home).

Currently it is pretty empty, but I plan on using this as a hub for my various accounts and a way to post devlogs of my current projects. If you have somehow stumbled upon this, bookmark [the page](https://github.com/SoysCodingCafe/home) and check back later!
